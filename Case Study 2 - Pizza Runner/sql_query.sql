Clean Data

The customer_order table has inconsistent data types.  We must first clean the data before answering any questions. 
The exclusions and extras columns contain values that are either 'null' (text), null (data type) or '' (empty).
We will create a temporary table where all forms of null will be transformed to null (data type).
