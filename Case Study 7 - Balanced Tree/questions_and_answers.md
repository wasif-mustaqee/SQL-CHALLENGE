### by jaime.m.shaker@gmail.com

**A.  High Level Sales Analysis**

The first question is asked vaguely.  Although I feel the second answer is the correct one, the question is somewhat ambiguous so I added a little clarification. jaime.m.shaker@gmail.com 

#### 1a. What was the total quantity sold for all products?

````sql
SELECT sum(qty) AS total_product_quantity
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
````

**Results:**

total_product_quantity|
----------------------|
45216|

#### 1b. What was the total quantity sold for EACH product?

````sql
SELECT pd.product_name,
	sum(s.qty) AS total_quantity
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
	JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC;
````

**Results:**

product_name                    |total_quantity|
--------------------------------|--------------|
Grey Fashion Jacket - Womens    |          3876|

		2
	) AS total_discounts
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
````

**Results:**

total_discounts|
---------------|
156229.14|

#### 3b. What is the total discount for EACH product?  I will include total item revenue with this query.

````sql
SELECT pd.product_name,
	sum(s.price * s.qty) AS total_item_revenue,
	round(
		sum((s.price * s.qty) * (s.discount::NUMERIC / 100)),
		2
	) AS total_item_discounts
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
	JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd ON pd.product_id = s.prod_id
GROUP BY pd.product_name
ORDER BY total_item_revenue desc;
````

**Results:**

product_name                    |total_item_revenue|total_item_discounts|
--------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|

**B.  Transaction Analysis**

#### 1. How many unique transactions were there?

````sql
SELECT count(DISTINCT txn_id) AS unique_transactions
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
````

**Results:** 

unique_transactions|
-------------------|
2500|

#### 2. What is the average unique products purchased in each transaction? I believe this is another oddly worded question.  I interpret this question to ask "What is the average NUMBER OF unique items purchased per transaction?"

````sql
WITH get_item_count AS (
	SELECT
		count(DISTINCT s.prod_id) unique_item
	FROM
		balanced_tree.sales AS s
	GROUP BY
		s.txn_id
)
SELECT
	round(avg(unique_item)) AS avg_number_of_items
FROM
	get_item_count;
````

**Results:** 

avg_number_of_items|
-------------------|
6|

#### 3. What are the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile values for the revenue per transaction?

````sql
WITH get_revenue AS (
	SELECT txn_id,
		round(
			sum((price * qty) * (1 - discount::NUMERIC / 100)),
			2
		) AS revenue
	FROM balanced_tree.sales
	GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT percentile_disc(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (
		ORDER BY revenue
	) AS "25th_percentile",
	percentile_disc(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (
		ORDER BY revenue
	) AS "50th_percentile",
	percentile_disc(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (
		ORDER BY revenue
	) AS "75th_percentile"
FROM get_revenue;
````

**Results:** : 

25th_percentile|50th_percentile|75th_percentile|
---------------|---------------|---------------|
326.18|         441.00|         572.75|

#### 4. What is the average discount value per transaction?

````sql
WITH get_avg_discount AS (
	SELECT txn_id,
		round(
			sum((price * qty) * (discount::NUMERIC / 100)),
			2
		) AS discount
	FROM balanced_tree.sales
	GROUP BY txn_id
)
SELECT round(avg(discount), 2) avg_discount
FROM get_avg_discount;
````

**Results:**

avg_discount|
------------|
62.49|

#### 5. What is the percentage split of all transactions for members vs non-members?

````sql
SELECT round(
		100 * (
			SELECT count(DISTINCT txn_id)
			FROM balanced_tree.sales
			WHERE member = 't'
		)::numeric / count(DISTINCT txn_id),
		2
	) AS member_percentage,
	round(
		100 * (
			SELECT count(DISTINCT txn_id)
			FROM balanced_tree.sales
			WHERE member = 'f'
		)::numeric / count(DISTINCT txn_id),
		2
	) AS non_member_percentage
FROM balanced_tree.sales;
````

**Results:**

member_percentage|non_member_percentage|
-----------------|---------------------|
60.20|                39.80|

or

````sql
SELECT member,
	-- The OVER clause allows us to nest aggregate functions
	round(
		100 * (
			count(DISTINCT txn_id) / sum(count(DISTINCT txn_id)) OVER()
		),
		2
	) AS percentage_distribution
FROM balanced_tree.sales
GROUP BY MEMBER;
````

**Results:**

member|percentage_distribution|
------|-----------------------|
false |                  39.80|
true  |                  60.20|

#### 6. What is the average revenue for member transactions and non-member transactions?

````sql
WITH get_all_revenue AS (
	SELECT
		txn_id,
		member,
		round(sum((price * qty) * (1 - discount::NUMERIC / 100)), 2) AS revenue
	FROM
		balanced_tree.sales
	GROUP BY
		txn_id,
		member
)
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN member = 't' THEN 'Member'
		ELSE 'Non-Member'
	END AS membership_status,
	round(avg(revenue), 2) AS avg_revenue
from
	get_all_revenue
GROUP BY
	MEMBER;
````

**Results:**

membership_status|avg_revenue|
-----------------|-----------|
Non-Member       |     452.01|
Member           |     454.14|

**C.  Product Analysis**

#### 1. What are the top 3 products by total revenue before discount?

	sum(s.price * s.qty) AS total_revenue
FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s

GROUP BY pd.product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;

#### 10. What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction?

This question had me stumped and I was not able to get it quite right.  After some searching and studying, I 
 found a great working example done by https://github.com/muryulia/.  By following her example, I was able to understand the logic behind her answer. This is a combinatorics question. https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Combinatorics.html
 
 You essentially make EVERY possible 3 product combination and count how many times each set occurs, apply a row number using a window function and pick the first one.  I will attempt to comment the code to explain how it works. 

````sql
-- Select the 3 item combination and the count of the amount of times items where bought together.               
SELECT product_1,
	product_2,
	product_3,
	times_bought_together
FROM (
		-- Create a CTE that joins the Sales table with the Product Details table and gather the
		-- transaction id's and product names.
		with products AS(
			SELECT txn_id,
				product_name
			FROM balanced_tree.sales AS s
				JOIN balanced_tree.product_details AS pd ON s.prod_id = pd.product_id
		) -- Use self-joins to create every combination of products.  Each column is derived from its own table.
		SELECT p.product_name AS product_1,
			p1.product_name AS product_2,
			p2.product_name AS product_3,
			COUNT(*) AS times_bought_together,
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
				ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
			) AS rank -- Use a window function to apply a unique row number to each permutation.
		FROM products AS p
			JOIN products AS p1 ON p.txn_id = p1.txn_id -- Self-join table 1 to table 2
			AND p.product_name != p1.product_name -- Ensure that we DO NOT duplicate items.
			AND p.product_name < p1.product_name -- Self-join table 1 to table 3
			JOIN products AS p2 ON p.txn_id = p2.txn_id
			AND p.product_name != p2.product_name -- Ensure that we DO NOT duplicate items in the first table.
			AND p1.product_name != p2.product_name -- Ensure that we DO NOT duplicate items in the second table.
			AND p.product_name < p2.product_name
			AND p1.product_name < p2.product_name
		GROUP BY p.product_name,
			p1.product_name,
			p2.product_name
	) AS tmp
WHERE RANK = 1;
-- Filter only the highest ranking item.
````

**Results:**

product_1                   |product_2                  |product_3             |times_bought_together|

**D.  Bonus Challenge**

Use a single SQL query to transform the product_hierarchy and product_prices datasets to the product_details table.

````sql
SELECT pp.product_id,
	pp.price,
	ph.level_text || ' - ' || CASE
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 1
		OR ph.parent_id = 3
		OR ph.parent_id = 4 THEN 'Womens'
		ELSE 'Mens'
	END AS product_name,
	CASE
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 1
		OR ph.parent_id = 3
		OR ph.parent_id = 4 THEN 1
		ELSE 2
	END AS category_id,
	CASE
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 3 THEN 3
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 4 THEN 4
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 5 THEN 5
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 6 THEN 6
	END AS segment_id,
	pp.id AS style_id,
	CASE
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 1
		OR ph.parent_id = 3
		OR ph.parent_id = 4 THEN 'Womens'
		ELSE 'Mens'
	END AS category_name,
	CASE
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 3 THEN 'Jeans'
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 4 THEN 'Jacket'
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 5 THEN 'Shirt'
		WHEN ph.parent_id = 6 THEN 'Socks'
	END AS segment_name,
	ph.level_text AS style_name
FROM balanced_tree.product_hierarchy AS ph
	JOIN balanced_tree.product_prices AS pp ON ph.id = pp.id;
````

**Results:**

product_id|price|product_name              |category_id|segment_id|style_id|category_name|segment_name|style_name         |
