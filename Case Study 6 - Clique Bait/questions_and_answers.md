**3. Product Funnel Analysis**

#### 1. What is the total sales for the 4 weeks before and after 2020-06-15? What is the growth or reduction rate in actual values and percentage of sales? 

Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
* How many times was each product viewed?
* How many times was each product added to cart?
* How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
* How many times was each product purchased?	

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE product_info AS (
	WITH product_viewed AS (
		SELECT ph.page_id,
			sum(
				CASE
					WHEN event_type = 1 THEN 1
					ELSE 0
				END
			) AS n_page_views,
			sum(
				CASE
					WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1
					ELSE 0
				END
			) AS n_added_to_cart
		FROM page_hierarchy AS ph
			JOIN events AS e ON ph.page_id = e.page_id
		WHERE ph.product_id IS NOT NULL
		GROUP BY ph.page_id
	),
	product_purchased AS (
		SELECT e.page_id,
			sum(
				CASE
					WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1
					ELSE 0
				END
			) AS purchased_from_cart
		FROM page_hierarchy AS ph
			JOIN events AS e ON ph.page_id = e.page_id
		WHERE ph.product_id IS NOT NULL
			AND exists(
				SELECT visit_id
				FROM clique_bait.events
				WHERE event_type = 3
					AND e.visit_id = visit_id
			)
			AND ph.page_id NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
		GROUP BY e.page_id
	),
	product_abandoned AS (
		SELECT e.page_id,
			sum(
				CASE
					WHEN event_type = 2 THEN 1
					ELSE 0
				END
			) AS abandoned_in_cart
		FROM page_hierarchy AS ph
			JOIN events AS e ON ph.page_id = e.page_id
		WHERE ph.product_id IS NOT NULL
			AND NOT exists(
				SELECT visit_id
				FROM clique_bait.events
				WHERE event_type = 3
					AND e.visit_id = visit_id
			)
			AND ph.page_id NOT IN (1, 2, 12, 13)
		GROUP BY e.page_id
	)
	SELECT ph.page_id,
		ph.page_name,
		ph.product_category,
		pv.n_page_views,
		pv.n_added_to_cart,
		pp.purchased_from_cart,
		pa.abandoned_in_cart
	FROM page_hierarchy AS ph
		JOIN product_viewed AS pv ON pv.page_id = ph.page_id
		JOIN product_purchased AS pp ON pp.page_id = ph.page_id
		JOIN product_abandoned AS pa ON pa.page_id = ph.page_id
);
SELECT *
FROM product_info;
````

**Results:**

page_id|page_name     |product_category|n_page_views|n_added_to_cart|purchased_from_cart|abandoned_in_cart|
-------|--------------|----------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
3|Salmon        |Fish            |        1559|            938|                711|              227|
4|Kingfish      |Fish            |        1559|            920|                707|              213|
5|Tuna          |Fish            |        1515|            931|                697|              234|
6|Russian Caviar|Luxury          |        1563|            946|                697|              249|
7|Black Truffle |Luxury          |        1469|            924|                707|              217|
8|Abalone       |Shellfish       |        1525|            932|                699|              233|
9|Lobster       |Shellfish       |        1547|            968|                754|              214|
10|Crab          |Shellfish       |        1564|            949|                719|              230|
11|Oyster        |Shellfish       |        1568|            943|                726|              217|

Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each  product category instead of individual products.

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS category_info;
CREATE TEMP TABLE category_info AS (
	SELECT product_category,
		sum(n_page_views) AS total_page_view,
		sum(n_added_to_cart) AS total_added_to_cart,
		sum(purchased_from_cart) AS total_purchased,
		sum(abandoned_in_cart) AS total_abandoned
	FROM product_info
	GROUP BY product_category
);
SELECT *
FROM category_info;
````

**Results:**

product_category|total_page_view|total_added_to_cart|total_purchased|total_abandoned|
----------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
Luxury          |           3032|               1870|           1404|            466|
Shellfish       |           6204|               3792|           2898|            894|
Fish            |           4633|               2789|           2115|            674|

Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

#### 1. Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?

````sql
WITH rankings AS (
	SELECT page_name,
		RANK() OVER (
			ORDER BY n_page_views DESC
		) AS most_page_views,
		RANK() OVER (
			ORDER BY n_added_to_cart DESC
		) AS most_cart_adds,
		RANK() OVER (
			ORDER BY purchased_from_cart DESC
		) AS most_purchased
	FROM product_info
)
SELECT page_name,
	'Most Viewed' AS product
FROM rankings
WHERE most_page_views = 1
UNION
SELECT page_name,
	'Most Added' AS product
FROM rankings
WHERE most_cart_adds = 1
UNION
SELECT page_name,
	'Most Purchased' AS product
FROM rankings
WHERE most_purchased = 1;
````

**Results:**

page_name|product       |
---------|--------------|
Oyster   |Most Viewed   |
Lobster  |Most Added    |
Lobster  |Most Purchased|

#### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

````sql
SELECT page_name
from (
		SELECT page_name,
			abandoned_in_cart
		FROM product_info
		ORDER BY abandoned_in_cart DESC
		LIMIT 1
	) AS tmp;
````

**Results:**

page_name     |
--------------|
Russian Caviar|

#### 2. Which product was most likely to be abandoned?

````sql
SELECT page_name
from (
		SELECT page_name,
			abandoned_in_cart
		FROM product_info
		ORDER BY abandoned_in_cart DESC
		LIMIT 1
	) AS tmp;
````

**Results:**

page_name     |
--------------|
Russian Caviar|

‚ùó Initially I read the question as "Which is the most abandoned product".  However, the question is asking which product is 'most likely' to be abandoned.  So we must check which item has the highest probability of being viewed and abandoned.

````sql
SELECT page_name,
	-- Subtract difference from the largest purchased item
	100 - round(
		100 * purchased_from_cart::NUMERIC / n_added_to_cart,
		2
	) AS abandoned_ratio
FROM product_info
ORDER BY abandoned_ratio DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

**Results:**

page_name     |abandoned_ratio|
--------------|---------------|
Russian Caviar|          26.32|

#### 3. Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?

````sql
SELECT page_name,
	round(
		100 * purchased_from_cart::NUMERIC / n_page_views,
		2
	) AS purchased_views_ratio
FROM product_info
ORDER BY purchased_views_ratio DESC
LIMIT 1;
````

**Results:**

page_name|purchased_views_ratio|
---------|---------------------|
Lobster  |                48.74|

#### 4. What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?

````sql
SELECT round(
		avg(100 * n_added_to_cart::NUMERIC / n_page_views),
		2
	) AS views_added_ratio
FROM product_info;
````

**Results:**

views_added_ratio|
-----------------|
            60.95|

#### 5.  What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?

````sql
SELECT round(
		avg(
			100 * purchased_from_cart::NUMERIC / n_added_to_cart
		),
		2
	) AS added_purchased_ratio
FROM product_info;
````

**Results:**

added_purchased_ratio|
---------------------|
75.93|

**4. Campaigns Analysis**

Generate a table that has 1 single row for every unique visit_id record and has the following columns:
* user_id
* visit_id
* visit_start_time: the earliest event_time for each visit
* page_views: count of page views for each visit
* cart_adds: count of product cart add events for each visit
* purchase: 1/0 flag if a purchase event exists for each visit
* campaign_name: map the visit to a campaign if the visit_start_time falls between the start_date and end_date
* impression: count of ad impressions for each visit
* click: count of ad clicks for each visit
* (Optional column) cart_products: a comma separated text value with products added to the cart sorted by the order they were added to the cart (hint: use the sequence_number)	

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS campaign_analysis;
CREATE TEMP TABLE campaign_analysis AS (
	WITH purchase_check AS (

	GROUP BY e.visit_id,

SELECT *
FROM campaign_analysis
LIMIT 12;
